Google's Mesa is a highly scalable analytic data warehousing system that stores critical measurement data related to Googleâ€™s Internet advertising business. Mesa is designed to satisfy a complex and challenging set of user and systems require- ments, including near real-time data ingestion and querya- bility, as well as high availability, reliability, fault tolerance, and scalability for large data and query volumes. Specifi- cally, Mesa handles petabytes of data, processes millions of row updates per second, and serves billions of queries that fetch trillions of rows per day. Mesa is geo-replicated across multiple datacenters and provides consistent and repeatable query answers at low latency, even when an entire datacen- ter fails.

Our open source project - MesaDB, is inspired by Mesa. We are planning to build a simple, mesa-like database.
