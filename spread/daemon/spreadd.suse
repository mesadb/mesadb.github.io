#   Spread is an open source, high performance, fault tolerant, message processing 
#   system.  It is useful for application-level multicasting, node-to-node 
#   communiction, etc.  
# 
#   See:  http://www.spread.org for more details on Spread and its use.
#
#   Notes:
#          Assumes that the default port 4803 is being used.  Change this
#          by modifying the SP_PORT variable.
